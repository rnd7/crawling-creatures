# Lux & Lucid Crawling Creatures
I coded this for a video installation. It's just some random crawling creatures moving within the mask borders of an projection mapped plane.

## Installation
You need node and npm installed on your machine. It should work on all platforms electron supports. I only tested in on a linux machine.

```
npm install
```

## Run

```
npm start
```
## Usage
The user interface is almost non existent... You can manipulate the scene using keyboard commands. Move point to check which is selected.

```
?: toggle Info
Space: toggle Pause
m: toggle Mask Mode
o: show Mask
i: append Point
Shift + i: prepend Point
r: remove Point
PageUp: prev Point
PageDown: next Point
ArrowKeys: move Point
Shift + ArrowKeys: move Point faster
```
